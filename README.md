## Property Management Portal
 
Property management portal is a web-based java project where house owners, and customers can exchange information effectively and inexpensively. This system provides a user-friendly interface, satisfying the needs of the consumers. 

There are three roles in this system- Landlord, Admin, and Tenant.  
 - The landlord is the user who owns the house and wants it to give it for rent. The landlord will upload all the details of the house, including the number of rooms, locality, rent. 
 - Admin manages all the users of the system. 
 - Tenant is the one who is looking for a rental house. She/He can search the house according to the requirements and get the results accordingly.

Dashboard Page for admin:
- Display the last 10 properties rented.
- Display 10 most recent tenants.
- Display total income per location.

Dashboard Page for landlords:
- Display properties.
- Display total income per location.
- Display 10 properties whose leases end in a month.

#### Important Notes
---

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
